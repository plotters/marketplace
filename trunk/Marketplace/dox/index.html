<h3>What was a separate MPN application now run as a timer task inside Marketplace</h3> 
<h3>How does it work ?</h3> 
MarketplaceNotifier (MPN) is a WebObjects application, but one which runs in an unusual manner.  All the
work of MPN is done in the Application class, which then terminates.  This means that no Sessions are
ever created and so this isn't really a web application since it never presents any way for users to see
a web page.  This is not a technical requirement, it's a convenience which lets us use EOModels and 
Frameworks that the real Marketplace application uses.
<h3>Files/Directories required for MarketplaceNotifier (MPN)</h3> 
MPN uses two local frameworks:
<ul>
	<li><strong><tt>OracleDriver.framework</tt></strong> -- this framework is a convenient vehicle for 
	       the Oracle JDBC class library.  Presently it is carrying the ojdbc14.jar library.</li>
	<li><strong><tt>JakartaCommons.framework</tt></strong> -- this framework carries a suite of Jakarta
	       Commons jar files.  MPN uses the commons-lang library for some methods to perform time
	       arithmetic.</li>
</ul>

MPN uses three files/bundles in Resources:
<ul>
	<li><strong><tt>ITCSUser.eomodeld</tt></strong> -- trivially relates uniqname to an index that the Marketplace
	       database uses.</li>
	<li><strong><tt>MarketPlace.eomodeld</tt></strong> -- this is the Marketplace database.</li>
	<li><strong><tt>Properties</tt></strong> -- allows the application to be conditioned; in particular for testing
	       the property mpn.testApplication should be set to TRUE and the property mpn.testUser
	       set to the uniqname of the person who should get all the notification messages.</li>
</ul>
